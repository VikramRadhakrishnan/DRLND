# Project 3: Collaboration and Competition

## Introduction
In this project we train a pair of tennis-playing agents to keep a ball in the air for as long as possbible by hitting it back and forth to each other. The two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. Both agents share a common goal of keeping the ball in play (i.e. not letting the ball hit the ground and not hitting the ball out of bounds) for as long as possible. See the animation below, taken from the Udacity deep reinforcement learning git repository, for a visual example of a pair of trained agents.
